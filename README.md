# Apollo_Automation

This script automates the process of enriching contact data on Apollo.io. Using Python and Selenium, it handles the following tasks:

- Logs in to Apollo.io with provided credentials.
- Processes a list of URLs representing contact lists.
- Selects contact rows, applies filters, and enriches email data.
- Navigates through paginated contact lists and repeats the enrichment process.

The script includes robust exception handling to manage common Selenium errors, making it reliable for large-scale data processing tasks.
